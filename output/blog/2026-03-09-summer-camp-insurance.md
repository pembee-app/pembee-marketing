# Summer camp insurance: what you need to know before camp season

If you're running a summer camp, insurance probably isn't the part you're most excited about. But it's one of the most important boxes to tick before registration opens.

Summer camp insurance protects your campers, your staff, and your business from the unexpected. Whether it's a sprained ankle at a basketball camp or property damage from a storm at your sports camp facility, the right coverage means one bad day doesn't put your entire operation at risk.

This guide covers the types of property and liability camp insurance you need, what they cost, where to find providers, and how to make sure you're properly covered before the first day of camp.

## Who needs camp insurance?

Camp insurance isn't just for traditional overnight camps. If you're running any kind of organized program for young people, you likely need coverage. This includes:

- **Sports camps and clinics** — basketball camps, youth sports clinics, youth all-sports clinics, and sports camps & clinics of any kind
- **Resident camps** — traditional overnight camps with bunks and multi-day stays
- **Day camps** — afterschool programs, holiday programs, and community and civic participant programs
- **Adventure and wilderness camps** — hiking, kayaking, recreational boating, and outdoor survival programs
- **Specialty camps** — arts and crafts camps, science and technology camps, performing arts, and leadership camps
- **Youth organizations** — Girl Scout councils, Boys & Girls Clubs, Youth Centers, and Youth Clubs
- **Retreat and conference programs** — conference centers and religious retreats that host youth programs

Whether you're running a week-long sports camp or a full-summer residential program, the core insurance needs are similar — though the specifics will vary based on your activities and setup.

## Types of summer camp insurance you need

There's no single policy that covers everything. Most camp operators need a combination of coverage types. Here's what to know about each one.

### General liability insurance

This is the foundation of any camp insurance program. General liability covers claims of bodily injury, property damage, and personal injury that occur during camp operations — often referred to as legal liability. If a camper gets hurt on your premises or a parent trips in your parking lot, this is the policy that responds.

Most policies include a General Aggregate limit (the maximum the insurer will pay across all claims in a policy period) and Products-Completed Operations coverage, which protects against claims arising after an activity or service has been completed.

Participant liability is also worth understanding — this covers injuries to people actively taking part in your camp activities, which is distinct from general public liability.

Most camps carry between $1 million and $2 million in general liability coverage. It's the one policy you absolutely cannot skip.

### Camp Directors Professional Liability

Also known as errors and omissions (E&O) insurance, Camp Directors Professional Liability covers claims related to the professional services you provide — things like negligence in instruction or failure to deliver on a promised program.

If your camp involves coaching, teaching, or any kind of specialized instruction, this coverage protects the decisions and advice your camp instructors and directors give in the course of running the program. It's especially relevant for sports camps where injury risk during instruction is higher.

### Camp accident insurance

General liability covers your legal responsibility, but camp accident insurance (also called participant accident coverages) covers the actual medical treatment costs when a camper or staff member gets injured — regardless of who's at fault.

Standard policies typically provide $10,000 to $25,000 per incident for medical expenses, with a small deductible (often around $100). For camps that want broader protection, Excess Accident Medical coverage is available and extends those limits significantly — useful for programs with higher-risk activities.

This can cover emergency room visits, X-rays, and follow-up care without families having to go through a lengthy claims process.

### Camp Property Insurance

If your camp owns or leases a physical space, Camp Property Insurance protects your buildings, equipment, furniture, and supplies against damage from theft, vandalism, fire, or natural disasters.

There are two main types of property policies to understand:

- **Replacement Cost Policy** — pays to replace damaged items with new equivalents, regardless of depreciation
- **Actual Cash Value Policy** — pays the current market value of damaged items, factoring in depreciation

Replacement cost is generally the better option, though it comes at a higher premium. Many camp operators also add Business Income Insurance, which covers lost revenue if your camp has to shut down temporarily due to a covered event.

For equipment that moves between locations (think portable sports gear, AV equipment, or supplies you transport to field trips), Inland Marine insurance covers property in transit or stored off-site — something standard property policies often exclude.

### Workers' compensation

If you employ staff (and most camps do), workers' compensation is typically a legal requirement. It covers medical expenses and lost wages for employees who are injured on the job.

This includes your counselors, camp instructors, Camp Medical Personnel, facilities maintenance crews, culinary staff, and admin team. Coverage for Volunteer Workers varies by state — some jurisdictions require it, others don't. Check your local regulations.

### Abuse or Molestation coverage

This is a sensitive but essential coverage area. Abuse or Molestation coverage (sometimes listed as Sexual Abuse and Molestation) protects against claims related to sexual, physical, or emotional abuse, as well as bullying.

To qualify, most insurers require camps to demonstrate robust safeguards:

- Criminal background checks for all staff through a reputable background check company
- Mandatory sexual abuse training for counselors and volunteers
- A written code of conduct
- Clear reporting procedures
- Appropriate ratio of counselors to campers

These aren't just insurance requirements — they're best practices every camp should follow. Insurers take eligibility for coverage in this area very seriously, and having documented procedures in place is non-negotiable.

### Vehicle liability

If your camp operates buses, vans, or any vehicles for transporting campers, you'll need vehicle liability insurance. For camps that don't own vehicles but occasionally use rented or employee-owned cars, non-owned and hired automobile coverage (also called Hired Auto & Non-Owned Auto) fills the gap. This is often overlooked but can be critical if a counselor drives campers to a field trip in their personal vehicle.

### Event and cancellation insurance

If your camp hosts special events (guest speakers, performances, competitions), event insurance provides additional coverage for those specific occasions.

Cancellation insurance is also worth considering — it protects against financial loss if you have to cancel camp sessions due to severe weather, facility issues, or other covered reasons. For camps that require significant upfront investment in staffing and supplies, this can be a financial lifeline.

### Travel insurance for overnight and trip-based camps

Camps that include travel — whether it's a bus trip to a national park or an international exchange program — should consider travel protection for participants. Key coverages include:

- **Trip Cancellation and Trip Cost coverage** — reimburses prepaid, non-refundable expenses if a trip is cancelled for a covered reason
- **Cancel for Any Reason** — a more flexible (and pricier) option that covers cancellations regardless of the cause
- **Emergency Medical Expense** — covers medical treatment costs incurred during a trip
- **Trip Interruption** — covers additional expenses if a trip is cut short
- **Emergency Evacuation & Repatriation** — covers transport to a medical facility or back home in an emergency
- **Baggage & Personal Effects** — covers lost, stolen, or damaged belongings during travel
- **Travel Assistance Services** — 24/7 support for Travel Arrangements, medical referrals, and coordination during emergencies

Providers like Travel Insured International (underwritten by Crum & Forster, with assistance from Global Excel Management) offer packages designed for group travel that can be tailored to camp programs.

### Third-Party Crime insurance

This covers losses from theft, fraud, or dishonest acts committed by third parties (not employees — that's typically covered under a separate fidelity bond). If your camp handles cash payments or stores valuable equipment, it's worth considering.

## How much does summer camp insurance cost?

Costs vary depending on several factors. Here's a rough guide for common coverage types:

| Coverage type | Typical cost |
|--------------|-------------|
| General liability ($1M–$2M) | $37–$59/month |
| Professional liability | $20–$50/month |
| Camp accident insurance | $3–$8 per camper |
| Property insurance | Varies by value of assets |
| Workers' compensation | Varies by state and payroll |

For a small to mid-sized day camp, you might expect to pay somewhere between $1,000 and $3,000 per year for a comprehensive package. Resident camps, camps with higher-risk activities (water sports, climbing, horseback riding), or larger operations will pay more.

**Factors that affect your premium:**

- **Camper ages** — younger children and teens may carry different risk profiles
- **Camp duration** — a week-long camp costs less to insure than a full-summer program
- **Camp location** — urban, rural, and wilderness settings each carry different risks
- **Types of activities** — higher-risk activities like recreational boating or adventure sports increase premiums
- **Equipment problems** — a history of gear-related incidents can raise costs
- **Number of staff** — including the ratio of counselors to campers
- **Claims history** — a clean record keeps premiums lower
- **Safety Programs** — documented safety procedures and training can qualify you for discounts

> **Tip:** Many insurers offer bundled packages (sometimes called a Camp Operators Package) specifically designed for camps. These can be more cost-effective than buying each policy separately.

## Where to find camp insurance providers

Several insurers specialize in camp and youth program coverage. Here are some of the more established names:

- **[Sadler Sports & Recreation Insurance](https://www.sadlersports.com)** — specializes in sports camp insurance, day camps, and youth sports clinics. Offers online quotes.
- **[Philadelphia Insurance Companies](https://www.phly.com)** — offers comprehensive camp programs including property, liability, and abuse coverage
- **[A-G Specialty Insurance](https://agspecialtyinsurance.com)** — provides tailored coverage for sports camps and recreation programs
- **[American Specialty Express](https://americanspecialtyexpress.com)** — offers event and camp insurance with quick-turnaround quotes
- **[Westpoint Insurance](https://westpointinsurance.com)** — covers a range of camp and youth program operations
- **[K&K Insurance](https://www.kandkinsurance.com)** — one of the largest camp insurance providers, with a dedicated Camp Insurance program

Some organizations also offer group insurance programs. The **SCMAF Recreation Day Camp Insurance Program**, for example, provides coverage specifically for recreation-focused day camps at group rates.

When reaching out to a provider, expect to fill out a Request for Insurance form detailing your camp's activities, staff count, location, and safety procedures. Most providers can issue certificates of insurance (a certificate of insurance is proof of coverage that venues and partners may require) within a few business days.

Look for insurers that offer Specialized loss control guidance and Risk Management Services — these go beyond just selling you a policy and actually help you reduce risk through Active Claims Management, safety audits, and operational recommendations.

## Eligibility: what insurers look for

Before an insurer will cover your camp, they'll assess your eligibility for coverage based on several factors:

- **Background checks** for all staff and volunteers through a reputable background check company
- **Written policies** for abuse prevention, emergency procedures, and risk management
- **Ratio of counselors to campers** that meets or exceeds industry standards
- **Staff training documentation** — first aid, CPR, sexual abuse training, and activity-specific Safety Programs
- **Camp instructor contracts** — clear agreements with camp instructors outlining responsibilities and conduct expectations
- **Incident reporting procedures** with documented processes
- **Waiver of liability** forms signed by all participants/guardians

Having these in place doesn't just help you qualify for coverage — it makes your camp safer and more professional.

## How Camp Registration & Consent Forms help with compliance

One thing that makes insurance and compliance easier? Collecting the right information upfront when families register.

Well-designed Camp Registration & Consent Forms capture the details you need to protect both your campers and your camp:

- **Medical information** — allergies, medications, conditions that camp instructors need to know about
- **Emergency contacts** — who to call if something happens
- **Waiver of liability** — liability waivers, photo consent, and activity-specific permissions
- **Dietary needs** — important for camps that provide meals (your culinary staff will thank you)
- **Activity permissions** — specific consent for higher-risk activities

Having this information on file before the first day of camp isn't just good practice — many insurance policies require it. If you're still collecting this on paper, an online registration system can make the process significantly easier for both you and the families you serve.

## Frequently asked questions

### Is summer camp insurance legally required?

It depends on where you operate. Some states and local jurisdictions require camps to carry liability insurance, while others don't mandate it by law. However, even where it's not legally required, most venues and facilities will require a certificate of insurance before letting you operate on their premises. In practice, running a camp without insurance is risky regardless of the legal requirement.

### What's the difference between sports camp insurance and regular camp insurance?

Sports camp insurance covers the same core areas (liability, property, accident) but is tailored to the higher-risk profile of athletic activities. Sports camps, youth sports clinics, and basketball camps often face more frequent injury claims, so premiums may be higher and policies may include specific exclusions or requirements around equipment safety and instructor qualifications.

### How far in advance should I arrange camp insurance?

Ideally, arrange your insurance at least two to three months before camp starts. This gives you time to shop around, compare policies, and make sure your coverage is in place well before registration opens. Some insurers offer year-round policies even if your camp only runs seasonally. You can typically Schedule an Appointment with a specialist agent to walk through your needs.

### Can I get insurance for a camp I run from a school or community center?

Yes, but there are a couple of things to keep in mind. The facility owner will likely require you to name them as an additional insured on your policy — they'll want to see certificates of insurance before you move in. You'll also want to confirm what their insurance covers versus what yours needs to cover — there's often a gap between the two.

### What happens if a camper gets injured and I don't have insurance?

Without insurance, you'd be personally responsible for all medical treatment costs and legal fees. A single serious injury claim can easily reach six figures. For small camp operators, this could mean financial ruin. Camp accident insurance exists specifically to prevent this scenario.

### Do I need separate insurance for each type of camp I run?

Not necessarily. Many insurers offer a Camp Operators Package that covers multiple program types under one policy — so your day camp, sports camps & clinics, and specialty camp sessions can all be covered together. Talk to your provider about bundling.

## Getting ready for camp season

Insurance is just one piece of the puzzle when it comes to running a successful camp, but it's one you can't afford to overlook. Start early, get the right coverage, and make sure your policies and procedures are solid.

Once your insurance is sorted, you can focus on what really matters — building a camp experience that kids and families remember.
