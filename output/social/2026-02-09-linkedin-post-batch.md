## Post 1: Camps

**Format:** Text post with image/video
**Theme:** Summer camp registration urgency (timely for Feb/Mar)

---

You might think February is too early to open camp registrations.

But here's what we see every year...

The camps that fill up aren't necessarily the best camps. They're the ones that started promoting earliest.

Early-bird parents are your best parents. They're organized, they commit, and they tell other parents. By the time everyone else opens registration in May, these camps are already full.

Here's what the early movers do differently:

→ They set dates and pricing now (not when it's "perfect")
→ They email last year's families first — warmest leads you'll ever have
→ They open registration with an early-bird offer to create urgency
→ They make it easy to book online — no PDFs, no back-and-forth emails

That last one matters more than most people think. A parent browsing camps on their phone at 9pm won't fill in a PDF form. But they will tap "book now" if it takes 60 seconds.

That's exactly what we built Pembee to do — give camp providers a branded booking page where parents can register, pay, and submit all the details you need (medical info, emergency contacts, permissions) in one go.

Don't be late to your own sign-up window. The early bird really does get the bookings.

## Post 2: 24/7 Booking

**Format:** Text post with image (create a simple branded graphic showing the stat)
**Theme:** When parents actually book

---

Most parents don't book activities during business hours.

Across Pembee's booking data, the pattern is clear: sign-ups happen evenings and weekends. Parents browse after the kids are in bed, compare options with their Sunday morning coffee, or book on their phone during a lunch break.

If your only way to accept bookings is email, phone, forms or DMs, you're effectively closed when customers are ready to buy. By the time you reply, they've often found a better alternative and paid to secure the spot.

Your busiest sales hours are the ones you're not working.

Pembee solves that with a fully functional booking platform that captures bookings 24/7 while you run great activities. It also saves hours of admin you didn't realise you were spending. The result: more bookings, less busywork, time back for what matters and satisfied customers.

## Post 3: Spreadsheets vs Pembee

**Format:** Text post
**Theme:** The real cost of "free" tools

---

"I'll just use Google Forms and a spreadsheet."

Every activity provider has said that at some point. I get it, it's free, it works, and you're busy running classes, not shopping for software.

But here's what "free" actually costs you:

• The parent who filled out your Google Form on Saturday night and never heard back — they booked somewhere else.
• The hours you spend copying data between spreadsheets, chasing bank transfers, and sending manual confirmations.
• The credibility you lose when a parent lands on a bare Google Form instead of a branded booking page.
• The bookings you'll never see because people leave when signing up aren't obvious or easy.

Free tools aren't free; they cost you time, bookings, and growth.

So the real question isn't "can I afford booking software?" It's "can I afford not to have it?"

What's the most manual process you're still running in your activity business?
