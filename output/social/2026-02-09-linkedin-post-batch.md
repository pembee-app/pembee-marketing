## Post 1: Educational Carousel

**Format:** Carousel / document post (create slides from the numbered points)
**Theme:** What parents look for before booking

---

4 things parents check before they book an activity for their kids.

(Miss any of these and you're losing sign-ups without realizing it.)

1. A professional-looking website.

Parents judge your activity by your online presence. If your website looks outdated — or you don't have one at all — they move on. First impressions happen in seconds.

2. Clear pricing. No surprises.

"Contact us for pricing" is a conversion killer. Parents want to see what it costs, what's included, and how payment works before they commit.

3. Easy online booking.

If a parent has to email you, wait for a reply, then do a bank transfer... you've already lost half of them. They want to book and pay in 60 seconds, usually from their phone.

4. A cancellation or refund policy.

It sounds small, but it matters. Parents want to know what happens if their child gets sick or they need to change sessions. A clear policy builds trust.

Here's the thing — none of this requires a big budget. It just takes the right setup.

Which of these do you think matters most? Drop your answer below.

## Post 2: Contrarian Take

**Format:** Text post
**Theme:** The real cost of "free" tools

---

"I'll just use Google Forms and a spreadsheet."

Every activity provider has said this at some point. I get it — it's free, it works, and you're busy running classes, not shopping for software.

But here's what "free" is actually costing you:

The parent who filled out your Google Form on Saturday night and never heard back until Monday — they booked somewhere else.

The hours you spend every week copying data between spreadsheets, chasing bank transfers, and manually sending confirmation emails.

The professional credibility you lose when a parent lands on a Google Form instead of a proper booking page with your branding.

The bookings you'll never know about — because someone visited your page, didn't see an easy way to sign up, and just... left.

Free tools aren't free. They cost you time, bookings, and growth.

The question isn't "can I afford booking software?" It's "can I afford not to have it?"

What's the most manual process you're still running in your activity business?

## Post 3: Data / Stats Post

**Format:** Text post with an image (create a simple branded graphic showing the stat)
**Theme:** When parents actually book

---

Most parents don't book activities during business hours.

We looked at booking data across Pembee and the pattern is clear: evenings and weekends are when the sign-ups happen.

Parents are browsing activities after the kids are in bed. They're comparing options on Sunday morning with a coffee. They're booking from their phone during a lunch break.

If your only way to accept a booking is email, phone, or DMs — you're closed when your customers are ready to buy.

Think about that for a second.

Your busiest "sales hours" are the hours you're not working.

That's the case for 24/7 online booking in one sentence. Not because it's trendy. Because it matches how parents actually behave.

Is your booking system open when your customers are?

## Post 4: Seasonal / Timely

**Format:** Text post
**Theme:** Summer camp registration urgency (timely for Feb/Mar)

---

It's February.

If you run a summer camp, your registration should already be open.

I know that feels early. But here's what we see every year:

The camps that fill up fastest are the ones that open registration in February and March — not May.

Early-bird parents are your best parents. They're organized, they commit, and they tell other parents. Miss that window and you're competing for attention when every camp in town launches at the same time.

Here's a quick checklist:

→ Set your dates and pricing now (don't wait until it's "perfect")
→ Open registration with an early-bird incentive
→ Email last year's families first — they're your warmest leads
→ Post about it on social this week, not next month
→ Make it easy to book online (no PDFs, no email-only sign-ups)

The camps that struggle to fill aren't worse camps. They just started promoting later.

Don't be late to your own sign-up window.

When are you opening registration this year?

## Post 5: Lessons Learned / List Post

**Format:** Text post
**Theme:** What we've learned building for activity providers

---

5 things we've learned building software for activity providers:

1. Every vertical thinks they're unique — and they're right.

A dance studio, a martial arts school, and a summer camp all "run activities." But the way they manage bookings, schedules, and payments is completely different. Cookie-cutter software doesn't cut it.

2. Parents will book at 11pm if you let them.

We see it constantly. The moment you remove the friction of emails and phone calls, bookings start coming in at all hours. Especially evenings and weekends.

3. The real competitor isn't other software — it's the spreadsheet.

Most activity providers aren't switching from a competitor. They're switching from Excel, Google Sheets, or a notebook. That's a much bigger leap of trust.

4. A booking page is a marketing tool, not just an admin tool.

When parents land on a clean, branded booking page, they're more likely to sign up. It's not just about taking payments — it's about making a first impression.

5. Activity providers are some of the most passionate people in business.

They're coaches, teachers, artists, and mentors. They didn't start their business to do admin. Anything we can do to give them more time doing what they love is worth building.

Which one resonates with you?
