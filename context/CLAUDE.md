# Pembee — Business Context

## About Pembee

Pembee enables organizations to create a booking website for the activities they organize. Think of it as **Shopify for activity providers** — each organization gets their own branded website (on their own domain or a subdomain of pembee.app).

Activities include sports coaching, dance academies, camps, afterschool programs, forest schools, gymnastics, martial arts, performing arts, and more. These are often kids' activities but not exclusively.

**Website:** https://www.pembee.app

## Brand Voice & Style Guide

### Voice

**Friendly & approachable.** We talk like a knowledgeable friend, not a corporate brochure. We're warm, encouraging, and genuinely helpful.

### Tone Principles

- **Conversational** — Write like you're talking to a real person. Use contractions (we're, you'll, it's). Avoid jargon.
- **Encouraging** — Our audience are passionate people running activities. Celebrate what they do. Frame features as things that make their lives easier.
- **Clear & concise** — Respect the reader's time. Get to the point. Use short sentences and paragraphs.
- **Confident but not pushy** — We know our product is great. We don't need to oversell it.
- **Inclusive** — We serve diverse organizations across multiple countries. Avoid culturally specific idioms. Use gender-neutral language.

### Writing Style

- **Headings:** Sentence case ("How to set up your booking page" not "How To Set Up Your Booking Page")
- **Lists:** Use bullet points for scannability
- **Numbers:** Spell out one through nine, use numerals for 10+
- **Currency:** Default to USD ($) with local equivalents where relevant
- **Spelling:** Use US English as default (our primary markets include the US), but adapt for UK/AU/NZ audiences when targeting those markets specifically
- **CTAs:** Action-oriented and benefit-led ("Start your free trial" not "Sign up")
- **Avoid:** Buzzwords, hype language, superlatives without evidence, "revolutionary", "game-changing", "best-in-class"

### Brand Personality Keywords

Helpful, reliable, modern, approachable, empowering

- In comparison content (vs pages), be factual and fair
