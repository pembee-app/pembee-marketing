# Content Calendar Generator

Plan and organize Pembee's content schedule.

## Instructions

1. Read `context/CLAUDE.md` for content strategy and verticals.
2. Ask the user for:
   - **Time period** (week, month, quarter)
   - **Channels** (blog, social, email, all)
   - **Focus verticals** if any
   - **Upcoming events or seasonal themes** (e.g., summer camp season, back to school)
3. Generate a content calendar with:

### For Each Content Piece
- **Date** (suggested publish date)
- **Channel** (blog, LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, email)
- **Content type** (blog post, social post, email, etc.)
- **Topic/title**
- **Target keyword** (for blog/SEO content)
- **Target vertical**
- **Funnel stage** (awareness, consideration, decision)
- **Brief** (2-3 sentence summary of what to write)
- **CTA**

### Calendar Balance

Aim for this mix across the month:
- **Blog:** 4-8 posts/month (2 per week)
- **LinkedIn:** 3-5 posts/week
- **Facebook:** 3-5 posts/week
- **Instagram:** 3-4 posts/week
- **Email:** 2-4 campaigns/month

### Seasonal Themes to Consider
- **January:** New year, new activities — help providers plan their year
- **March-April:** Summer camp registration season (US/Canada)
- **May-June:** Summer prep, end of term
- **August-September:** Back to school, autumn term signups
- **October-November:** Holiday camps, winter activities
- **December:** Year in review, planning for next year

4. Save to `output/report/{YYYY-MM-DD}-content-calendar-{period}.md`
