# CORE-EEAT Content Benchmark — Skills Reference

> Based on [CORE-EEAT Content Benchmark](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/core-eeat-content-benchmark)
>
> This file is a reference adaptation for the SEO & GEO Skills Library. For the full benchmark with detailed examples, see the source repository.

**8 dimensions × 10 items = 80 evaluation criteria** for optimizing content visibility across AI engines (GEO) and search engines (SEO).

---

## 1. Framework Overview

### Two-System Architecture

| System | Focus | Dimensions | Items | Boundary |
|--------|-------|------------|-------|----------|
| CORE | GEO (AI Engine Optimization) | C, O, R, E | 40 | Content body |
| EEAT | SEO (Search Engine Optimization) | Exp, Ept, A, T | 40 | Author / Organization / Site |

**MECE Boundary Rule:** CORE evaluates the content body itself. EEAT evaluates the source — author, organization, and site credibility. There is no overlap.

### 8 Dimensions

| Abbr | Full Name | Core Question |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| C | Contextual Clarity | Does the content clearly answer the user's intent? |
| O | Organization | Is the content structured for both humans and machines? |
| R | Referenceability | Can AI and readers verify and cite the claims? |
| E | Exclusivity | Does the content offer something unavailable elsewhere? |
| Exp | Experience | Does the author demonstrate real-world experience? |
| Ept | Expertise | Does the author demonstrate professional expertise? |
| A | Authority | Is the author/org recognized as an authority? |
| T | Trust | Does the site meet trust and safety standards? |

### Priority Tags

- **GEO-First** 🎯 = Critical for AI engine citation
- **SEO-First** 🔍 = Critical for traditional search ranking
- **Dual** ⚡ = Important for both

## 3. Scoring System

### Per-Item Scoring

| Result | Score |
|--------|-------|
| Pass | 10 |
| Partial | 5 |
| Fail | 0 |

### Score Calculation

- **Dimension score** = sum of 10 items (0–100)
- **GEO Score** = (C + O + R + E) / 4
- **SEO Score** = (Exp + Ept + A + T) / 4
- **Total Score** = (GEO + SEO) / 2 — unweighted average for quick comparison
- **Weighted Score** = Σ (dimension_score × content_type_weight) — use this for content-type-specific evaluation (see table below)

### Content-Type Weight Table

| Dim | Product Review | How-to Guide | Comparison | Landing Page | Blog Post | FAQ Page | Alternative | Best-of | Testimonial |
|-----|---------------|--------------|------------|--------------|-----------|----------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| C | 10% | 20% | 10% | 20% | 25% | 25% | 10% | 10% | 10% |
| O | 10% | 20% | 20% | 10% | 10% | 25% | 15% | 25% | 5% |
| R | 15% | 10% | 25% | 5% | 10% | 15% | 25% | 20% | 15% |
| E | 20% | 5% | 10% | 5% | 20% | 5% | 5% | 15% | 10% |
| Exp | 20% | 5% | 5% | 5% | 10% | 5% | 15% | 5% | 30% |
| Ept | 5% | 20% | 15% | 5% | 10% | 10% | 5% | 10% | 5% |
| A | 5% | 5% | 5% | 25% | 5% | 5% | 5% | 5% | 5% |
| T | 15% | 15% | 10% | 25% | 10% | 10% | 20% | 10% | 20% |

### Rating Scale

| Score Range | Rating |
|-------------|--------|
| 90–100 | Excellent |
| 75–89 | Good |
| 60–74 | Medium |
| 40–59 | Low |
| 0–39 | Poor |

### Veto Items

The following items can override the overall score — a Fail on any veto item caps the total at "Low" regardless of other scores:

- **T04** — Affiliate links without disclosure
- **C01** — Clickbait (title doesn't match content)
- **R10** — Data contradicts itself
